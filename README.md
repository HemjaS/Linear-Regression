# Linear-Regression
This model predicts the demand of shared bikes with the available independent variables ; calculating which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands.

**Contents**
The repository contains a jupyter notebook with the code for linear regression model.
There is a PDF file that contains answers to all subjective questions.

**Technologies used**
Pyhton, Machine learning supervised models

**Conclusion**
The three most significant variables affecting the demand for shared bikes are :
1. temperature
2. year
3. winter season
